                <p>I am <span>Sambriddhi Shrestha</span>. I was born in the beautiful city of lakes, Pokhara, Nepal. I moved to
                    Kathmandu with my family 12 years ago. Currently, I am a resident of Nagarjun -4, Kathmandu, Nepal.
                    I love listening to music and taking pictures of the sky, especially sunsets. I am an animal lover.
                    I am a vegetarian and I take care of the community dogs and cats. I am a fresher in the BSc(Hons)
                    Computer Science program of Herald College Kathmandu, located in Naxal, Kathmandu. Herald college
                    Kathmandu provides one of the best and most affordable UK-degree in Nepal in affiliation with the
                    University of Wolverhampton, United Kingdom.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I like doing many things. I like listening to music. I sketch and doodle to get things off of my mind. I am also learning to play guitar. I would also like to count finding new places to eat tasty food as my hobby. Playing with my dogs and giving them pets is also something I tend to do a lot</p>

                <h2>skills</h2>
                <p>Now, I would like to talk about my core skills. Among many skills I possess, my leadership skill has been a relevant part of my growth. I put this skill to work as the school captain during my secondary school years. I took care of fellow students and marched forward many awareness rallies at that time. I was also the captain of my Scout troop. I have had many beautiful experiences with them. I also possess photography and public speaking skills. In addition to these, I paint, play the guitar, and do calligraphy.<br>As a student of Computer Science, I am learning programming languages for front-end and back-ende development. I am also a part of UI Visuals community, where I am sharpening my UI skills.

                <h2>Current Status</h2>
                <p>I am learning a lot in college and developing skills to be a programmer. I am a core member of the UI Visuals Community, where I am learning about UI design and leading a team. In the future, I plan to be a full-stack developer knowing both front-end and back-end development. I plan to intern at IT companies during summer breaks. After the completion of my internship and graduation, I plan to choose a leading IT company where I can further develop my skills.
